# rack_VIKWoCRH

The purpose of this repositry is to set the rack monitoring system for volts, amps, power, temp and humidity to be developed to a rack asset based system

The developed system will then set the foundations for the LB system that will integrate to overall genset systems.  The genset system will be a plug into our system
